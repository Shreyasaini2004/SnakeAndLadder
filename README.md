# SnakeAndLadder

Snakes and Ladders is a popular board game typically played on a 10x10 grid with 100 squares. The goal is to navigate from the start (square 1) to the finish (square 100), following the rules dictated by the snakes and ladders on the board. This project will focus on implementing the game mechanics, generating random snakes and ladders, simulating dice rolls, and using BFS to determine the shortest path to win the game. Also it efficiently solve the game by finding the minimum number of dice rolls required to win.Additionally, the game will support a two-player mode.
